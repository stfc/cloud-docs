Setting Up a local development environment

The following assumes you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 LTS through Windows Subsystem for Linux or natively with GitHub Desktop to manage interaction with GitHub.

Create a fork on GitHub and clone it into GitHub desktop.

First install the software necessary to build the repository

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-sphinx python3-sphinx-rtd-theme

Change into the directory you cloned the repository to.

Run the following to build a local copy of the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

Assuming that this succeeds, you can then open ./build/html/index.html in your web browser

Make any changes you wish to and then build again and test.
