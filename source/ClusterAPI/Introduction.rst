ClusterAPI Introduction
#######################

Cluster API is a platform agnostic way of managing physical resources (i.e. VMs) using
Kubernetes.

This provides a nuber of advantages including:
- Familiarity to experience K8s admins, as nodes act similarly to pods...etc.
- Tooling which directly supports Openstack, including resource creation and management.
- Support and fixes for newer Kuberenetes versions without waiting for Openstack upgrades.
