.. _swift_create_container:

Create a Container
------------------

In the Openstack web interface, expand `Object Store` and then click `Containers` on the left hand side of the screen.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/1-menu.png

Click `+ Container`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/2-create-container.png

On the `Create Container` screen, enter a name for the container and select whether the container should be publicly accessible, then click `Submit`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/3-create-container-form.png

.. warning::

  Selecting "public" will allow the contents of a container to be viewed by anyone, with no authentication required.
  See :ref:`swift_cli_editing_containers` or :ref:`swift_sdk_containers` for greater control over read and write access.

If successful, the container will be listed below the `+ Container` button.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/5-container-list.png

Details of the container may be viewed by clicking on the listing. This will also display a checkbox that may be clicked to enable or disable public access.

.. _swift_create_object:

Upload a File
-------------

Having selected a listed container, click the `Upload` icon next to `+ Folder`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/7-object-upload.png

Select a file to upload, and a unique name for it in the container. Then click `Upload File`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/8-object-form.png

.. warning::

  Files uploaded in this way must be less than 5GiB. See :ref:`swift_cli_large_objects` for instructions on uploading larger files.
  If `Error: Unable to upload the object` is displayed for a file smaller than this, you may need to contact the Cloud team to request a quota increase.


If successful, the file will be listed below the `Upload` icon.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/10-object-list.png

To view file details, select the arrow next to `Download` to view the options, then click `View Details`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/11-object-options.png

The file details will then be shown.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/12-object-details.png


.. _swift_create_folder:

Create a Folder
---------------

To create an empty folder, click `+ Folder`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/13-folder-create.png

Enter a unique folder name, then click `Create Folder`.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/14-folder-form.png

Alternatively, folders may be created by including a new folder name, followed by a delimiter ('/'), before the name of an uploaded file.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/16-folder-form-alt.png

If successful, the folder will be listed with other files in the container.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/17-folder-list.png

The contents of a folder may be viewed by clicking the folder listing.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/18-folder-contents.png


.. _swift_create_deep_folder:

Create Deep Folders
-------------------

When viewing a folder, a deep folder can be created by selecting `+ Folder`, as :ref:`previously <swift_create_folder>` when viewing a container.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/19-subfolder-create.png

Multiple levels of folders may be created by including delimiters ('/') between each folder name. Any folders specified that do not exist will be created.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/20-subfolders-create.png

This can equivalently be done when viewing the container, outside all folders.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/21-subfolders-create-alt.png

Alternatively, the new folder names may be included when uploading a file.

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/22-subfolders-create-alt-2.png

As when viewing a container, the next level of folders will be listed alongside files in the folder you are viewing. Deeper folders and files will not be displayed without navigating into their parent folders by selecting them.

.. _swift_delete_object:

Delete a File
-------------

To delete an individual file, select the arrow next to `Download` to view the file options, then clicking `Delete`.

.. _swift_copy_objects:

Copy a File

.. image:: /assets/howtos/CreateAContainer/32-object-copy.png

If successful, a success message will appear, and the copied file will be listed.


.. _swift_limitations:

Limitations
-----------

Some Swift features are unavabile through the GUI, and so must be performed using the :ref:`Python SDK <swift_python_sdk>` and/or the :ref:`CLI<swift_CLI>`. For example:

- :ref:`Viewing all metadata for your account, containers and objects <swift_cli_information>`
- :ref:`Uploading <swift_cli_upload_objects>` and :ref:`downloading <swift_cli_save_files>` multiple files simultaneously
- Setting metadata for :ref:`containers <swift_cli_editing_objects>` and :ref:`objects <swift_cli_editing_containers>`
- :ref:`Downloading containers <swift_cli_save_containers>`
- :ref:`Downloading folders <swift_cli_save_folders>`
- :ref:`Uploading files larger than 5GiB <swift_cli_large_objects>`
- :ref:`Creating temporary URLs <swift_cli_tempurl>`
